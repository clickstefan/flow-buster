# Rhythm Runner - Musical Adventure Game Development Brief

## Game Overview
Create a rhythm-based endless runner game where players navigate a magical world corrupted by discord, using musical timing and tempo manipulation to overcome obstacles and restore harmony.

## Theme & Story
- **Setting**: A fantasy realm where music maintains the natural balance of the world
- **Plot**: An evil force has corrupted the Great Symphony that keeps the kingdom in harmony. The player is a Melody Keeper who must restore the true rhythm to save the princess and realm.
- **Visual Style**: Magical/fantasy aesthetic with musical elements (floating notes, resonating crystals, harmonic auras)
- **Corruption manifests as obstacles** that sync with discordant music
- **Restoration happens** as players hit perfect timing, gradually beautifying the environment

## Core Mechanics

### Movement System
- **Auto-running character** moves forward automatically
- **Three horizontal platforms** (bottom, mid, top) representing different musical layers
- **Platform switching**: Swipe up/down during jumps to change lanes mid-air
- **Infinite gliding**: Character can stay airborne indefinitely between platforms
- **Jump controls**: Tap to jump, hold for longer jumps

### Musical Integration
- **Beat-synchronized obstacles** spawn in rhythm with the music
- **Perfect timing rewards**: Hitting beats precisely grants bonuses and restores harmony
- **Floating collectibles**: Musical notes positioned between beats for skilled players
- **Three-layer music mapping**: Each platform corresponds to different instruments (bass/rhythm/melody)

### Tempo Manipulation System
- **Time control**: Swipe left/right during gameplay to slow down (0.5x) or speed up (2x)
- **Tempo dial**: Visual feedback showing current speed multiplier during control
- **Harmony energy system**: 
  - Slowing down drains harmony energy (like audience getting bored)
  - Normal speed (1x) gradually restores energy
  - Perfect beat timing provides energy boosts
  - Running out of energy limits tempo control abilities

### Gesture Controls (Mobile-Optimized)
- **Tap**: Jump
- **Swipe up/down**: Change platform while airborne
- **Swipe left/right**: Activate tempo control with visual dial
- **All gestures should feel responsive** and work well on touchscreens

## Technical Requirements

### Performance & Platform
- **Target 60fps** for smooth rhythm gameplay
- **Primary platform**: Mobile (Android focus, iOS nice-to-have)
- **Secondary platform**: Web browser for easy sharing/testing
- **Lightweight**: Should run on mid-range mobile devices smoothly

### Audio Features
- **Real-time beat detection** from audio tracks
- **Pitch-shifting during tempo control** (speed changes affect pitch)
- **Audio analysis** to map obstacle patterns to musical structure
- **Support for multiple audio formats** (MP3, OGG, etc.)

### Content System
- **AI-generated music** or open-source tracks to avoid licensing
- **Hand-crafted levels** that sync obstacles to musical elements
- **Consistent BPM** tracks preferred for easier beat detection
- **Electronic/synthwave genres** recommended for clear beat patterns

### Multiplayer & Sharing
- **Level sharing system**: Players can share custom-created levels
- **Completion requirement**: Creators must finish their level at least once before sharing
- **Simple rating/discovery** system for community levels
- **Future feature**: Real-time multiplayer racing

## Development Considerations

### Framework Selection Criteria
- **Cross-platform deployment** (mobile + web)
- **Strong community support** with extensive documentation
- **Good performance** for real-time audio and smooth animations
- **Easy CI/CD integration** with GitHub workflows for automated testing/deployment
- **Commercial license friendly** for potential monetization
- **Lightweight and fast** development cycle for prototyping

### Architecture Needs
- **Modular audio system** for beat detection and tempo control
- **Level editor tools** for creating beat-mapped obstacle patterns
- **State management** for game progress, settings, and user-generated content
- **Responsive UI** that works across different screen sizes
- **Efficient rendering** for smooth scrolling backgrounds and particle effects

### Testing & Deployment
- **Automated testing** pipeline via GitHub Actions
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities for easy web distribution
- **Mobile app store** deployment automation
- **Performance monitoring** and crash reporting integration

## Success Metrics
- **Tight audio-visual sync** - obstacles feel naturally connected to music
- **Intuitive controls** - players can learn gestures quickly
- **Engaging progression** - difficulty scales well with musical complexity
- **Smooth performance** - consistent 60fps on target devices
- **Community adoption** - players actively create and share levels

## Deliverables
1. **Playable prototype** with core mechanics working
2. **3-5 demo levels** showcasing different musical styles
3. **Level creation tools** for community content
4. **Deployment pipeline** for automated releases
5. **Documentation** for level creation and game mechanics

## Questions to address before starting
1. **Which framework/engine** would you recommend for optimal performance and development speed?
2. **What's your approach** for real-time audio analysis and beat detection?
3. **How would you implement** smooth tempo control with pitch shifting?
4. **What testing strategy** would you use for rhythm-based gameplay?
5. **How would you structure** the GitHub workflow for automated deployment to multiple platforms?

Please suggest your preferred tech stack considering ease of development, performance requirements, and deployment automation.
